### CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED ✅
**Forms Page Description Field Input Issue - FIXED**

**Problem**: The description field in the Create Form dialog was not persisting user input and kept reverting to placeholder text.

**Root Cause**: The FormBuilderDialog component was using `defaultValue` instead of controlled state with `value` and `onChange` handlers.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Converted FormBuilderDialog to use controlled state with useState
- Added state management for formName, formType, and formDescription
- Replaced `defaultValue` with `value` and proper `onChange` handlers
- Updated form submission to use state values instead of FormData

**Code Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Before (problematic):
<Textarea
  id="description"
  name="description"
  defaultValue={form?.description}
  rows={3}
  placeholder="Describe the purpose of this form"
/>

// After (fixed):
const [formDescription, setFormDescription] = useState(form?.description || '')

<Textarea
  id="description"
  name="description"
  value={formDescription}
  onChange={(e) => setFormDescription(e.target.value)}
  rows={3}
  placeholder="Describe the purpose of this form"
/>
```

### NEW ISSUE IDENTIFIED ⚠️
**tRPC Authentication Issue**

**Problem**: Form creation is failing because the tRPC form router uses `protectedProcedure` which requires authentication, but we've temporarily disabled authentication for testing.

**Current State**: 
- Forms page UI: ✅ 100% functional
- Create Form dialog: ✅ 100% functional (description field fixed)
- Form submission: ❌ Failing due to authentication requirement
- Forms display: Shows 0 forms (API calls failing)

**Next Steps Required**:
1. Either temporarily modify form router to use `publicProcedure` for testing
2. Or implement mock session context for tRPC during testing phase
3. Test complete form creation workflow
4. Re-enable authentication after testing completion

### COMPLETED WORK SUMMARY

#### MAJOR FIXES COMPLETED ✅
1. **Fixed all critical build errors** - resolved TypeScript compilation issues
2. **Fixed users page data structure issues** - corrected Decimal type handling
3. **Added missing handleToggleStatus function** to users page
4. **Installed sonner package** for toast notifications
5. **Achieved successful production build** - all TypeScript errors resolved
